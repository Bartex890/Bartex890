### Hi there üëã
## üôç About me
I am a passionate programmer with expertise in C# and Unity. My primary focus is game development, and I have a strong background in managing projects and leading teams. Throughout my career, I have played various roles such as Product Manager, Scrum Master, and Unity Developer.

In my GitHub repository, you will find a collection of my projects, primarily in Unity. However, my interests extend beyond game development, and I have also worked on projects outside the Unity ecosystem. Feel free to explore my repository to see the diverse range of projects I have worked on.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on exciting projects, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's create something amazing together!
